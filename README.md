## **Project: Mosaic Planners**

## Description
We have created a Event Management Website which will provide services related to Venue Booking, Catering, Accomodation, Transportation and Tourism. Customers will get a number of options in each of the above services 

### My Contribution:
I created four pages under Tourism section. All the pages under Tourism section are fully responsive and dynamic, most of the content is dynamically loading from a JSON file. In the first page, Tourist Packages I have added a image slider in the cover section and have added different tourist packages and arranged them into different categories. The second page is dedicated to local guides where i have a cover picture on the top and I have added different profiles for local guides. In the bottom, I have an accordian for FAQ section created using JavaScript.Coming to third page, this page is for personalized travel requests where I have added some cards and a feedback slider in the bottom which is created using JavaScript. There is a button in the cover image section which will redirect the user to a service request form. Here in this form I am doing data validation on all the fields such as name, email, phone and date. In the date field, I am also restricting the user from entering a past date and checking whether the trip end date is greater than trip start date.
