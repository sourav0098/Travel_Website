                    <h3>Akash Kumar</h3>
                    <p>Just got back from a wonderful trip and it was a great experience overall. The travel
                        designer was easy to work with from the beginning. We received multiple
                        itineraries from multiple groups, but the one from this company was the most flexible. Since
                        ours was a private tour, the travel designer took the time to customize the schedule so we get
                        to see the most we can while still feeling rested and relaxed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="swiper-slide">
                    <img class="testimonial-slider-image" src="./images/avatar2.png" alt="" srcset="">
                    <h3>Priyank Sharma</h3>
                    <p>This was our first trip and the experience could not have turned out better. First, the agents
                        that they recommended were attentive and experienced in their efforts to determine what we
                        wanted out of our trip and to make it happen to meet our expectations. The most difficult part
                        of the planning process was having to make a choice of which agent to choose. They were both
                        excellent in their planning and their proposals.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="swiper-slide">
                    <img class="testimonial-slider-image" src="./images/avatar3.png" alt="" srcset="">
                    <h3>Raghu Suri</h3>
                    <p>Our trip was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience and we are so grateful to everyone
                        that made it happen seamlessly. Our travel planner, Rahul was incredible. After reading our
                        initial request and speaking with us on the phone, he designed a tour perfectly custom to what
                        our interests were. He was always prompt and thorough in his responses and we felt very
                        comfortable taking his recommendations</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Ridhi Dogra</h3>
                    <p>Mosaic Planers organised our visit to Kerala. They put together an itinerary that suited us. We
                        wanted to be more off the beaten track but still comfortable. Our stays at coffee and tea
                        plantations, safari lodge, a beach resort and houseboat on the North Kerala backwaters, were
                        delightful and exceeded our expectations. The underlying organisation of the trip meant we had
                        no worries about where we should be and how we should get there.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Sanjay Kumar</h3>
                    <p>We had a wonderful holiday in Rajasthan which will remain long in the memory. India is a
                        breathtakingly beautiful country full of splendid temples and palaces, noise and colour,
                        peaceful rural scenes and most of all friendly welcoming people. We stayed in some amazing
                        hotels and had brilliant guides who made us feel like friends. Even the noise and bustle is an
                        experience in itself and we enjoyed the contrast between the busy streets, quiet hotels and
                        rural experiences.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Neha Sharma</h3>
                    <p>We started with a few days in Mumbai & ended in Delhi, from where we visited the Taj Mahal. In
                        between we visited Bhopal and Satpura and Kanha National Parks. It was a good mixture given the
                        contrast between the busy cities & quiet beautiful national parks. We particularly liked the
                        peacefulness & variety of wildlife in the countryside. The accommodation & guides were excellent
                        throughout our stay.</p>
